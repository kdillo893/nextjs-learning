## running scripts

View the package.json for examples.

This module uses ```next``` to execute and run things.

```
npm run build
```
-> this will build the package.

```
npm run dev
```
-> this will deploy a development server at localhost for running the environment.

```
npm run start
```
-> if there is a valid configuration for production deployment, this will deploy
the application as if it were a production environment (do this at the desired
server)
